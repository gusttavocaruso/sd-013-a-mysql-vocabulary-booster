      (coluna_2) AS 'PaÃ­s',
      (coluna_3) (subquery_1) AS 'NÃºmero de compatriotas'

  SELECT 
      C1.contactName AS 'Nome',
      C1.country AS 'PaÃ­s',
      (SELECT
            COUNT(*) - 1
        FROM
            w3schools.customers AS C2
        WHERE
            C1.Country = C2.Country
      GROUP BY C2.country) AS 'NÃºmero de compatriotas',
  FROM
      w3schools.customers AS C1
  WHERE (subquery_2)
  ORDER BY `Nome`;
*/

/*
3. Montando a subquery 2:

  SELECT 
      C1.contactName AS 'Nome',
      C1.country AS 'PaÃ­s',
      (SELECT
            COUNT(*) - 1
        FROM
            w3schools.customers AS C2
        WHERE
            C1.country = C2.country
      GROUP BY C2.country) AS 'NÃºmero de compatriotas'
  FROM
      w3schools.customers AS C1
  WHERE
      (SELECT

          FROM
              w3schools.customers AS C2
          WHERE
              C1.country = C2.country
      GROUP BY C2.country) > 0
  ORDER BY `Nome`;
*/

SELECT

    C1.Country AS 'PaÃ­s',
    (SELECT 
            COUNT(*) - 1
        FROM
